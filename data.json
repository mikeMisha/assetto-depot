Consisting of tight bends and fast sweepers, they are perfect for racing, drifting, cruising or driving with friends. There are also numerous junctions, turnouts, picnic areas, parking areas and various side roads which are included as useful hideouts for NFS style pursuits. Roads are fully signed and include real world distance signs, speed & warning signs, markings, guard rails, jersey barricades and multiple dynamic parked vehicles."

Driving enthusiasts should not confuse this with Mulholland Highway however, which is further to the west near Malibu (although I DO have plans to create some of that road as well). This is the stretch between the 405 and 101 freeways, a two-lane road traversing a mix of both residential areas with narrow curbed streets and twisty scenic sections with dirt shoulders. A lack of guardrails in many places will leave you in constant danger of going over the edge if not careful, and the varying shoulder conditions will require some exploration to discover which corners can be cut and which curbs should be avoided!"

Seven lives were lost in the circuit's 11 year history. There were no run-off areas, and most of the fast bends were surrounded by trees."

It has Eau Rouge type corner, a bumpy concrete carousel at the end and many corners over the hills that are hard to learn but fun to drive when you know them. Track has 46 pitboxes, which I can not even use, but if you feel like you want more then that, I can do it. There is plenty of room left."
